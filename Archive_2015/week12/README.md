#Lecture
##Week 12 - More External Modules - Matpotlib for plotting data
##### Today we will discuss how to use Matplotlib for plotting vector and raster data.


1. matplotlib is a powerful library for plotting data (http://matplotlib.org/)
  1. Plots arrays (or array like objects such as python lists)
  2. Sometimes arrays have to be manipulated to be the correct dimensions.
  3. Often best start with an example and modify to what you want to do.
    1. Histograms
	2. Scatter Plot
  
#Lab 

Here is your assignment (You have two weeks to finish this assignment).

1. Create script that makes a histogram of any one of the statistics you generated from Lab 8 or 9 (metrics of shape for cities of mississippi)
  1. Tell me about the distribution of your data. Does that distribution look normal?
  2. Your script should report the mean and standard dev of the data. (There are already array methods for calculating these values).
1. Make a scatter plot of the surface lapse rate in Europe using the data provided.
  1. The lapse rate is defined as the rate at which temperature decreases with increase in altitude.
  2. Modify your script using the numpy where function to find the lapse rate only in forested areas (land cover less than 11).  
  3. Is this different than the overall lapse rate?  Explain and show your graphs.

You should turn in two scripts and email the answers to the questions.
